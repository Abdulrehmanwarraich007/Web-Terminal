# Web Terminal API

A RESTful API for managing authors, borrowers, and borrowing transactions in a library system. This API allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on authors, borrowers, and borrowings.

## Project Overview

This project implements a simple backend API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to manage:

- Authors: Create, Read, Update, and Delete author details.
- Borrowers: Create, Read, Update, and Delete borrower details.
- Borrowings: Record and manage book borrowings with references to authors and borrowers.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime to execute server-side code.
- **Express**: Framework for building the API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM to interact with MongoDB.
- **Postman**: Tool to test API endpoints.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (locally or using MongoDB Atlas)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for API testing (optional)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-terminal.git
cd web-terminal
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Set Up MongoDB Connection

- If you're using **MongoDB Atlas**, make sure you have created a cluster and obtained the connection string.
- If you're using **local MongoDB**, ensure it's installed and running.

Replace the MongoDB connection string in `src/app.js`:

```javascript
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/web-terminal', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
```

If you're using MongoDB Atlas, replace it with your Atlas connection string.

### Step 4: Start the Server

Run the application:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:3000`.

    }
    ```

- **Delete Borrowing**  
  - `DELETE /api/borrowings/:id`  
  - Deletes borrowing transaction by the given ID.

## Testing with Postman

Once the server is up and running, you can test all the API endpoints using **Postman**.

1. **Set the request type**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
2. **Set the URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/`
3. **For POST and PUT requests**, set the body to `raw` and select `JSON` format, then paste the required JSON payload.
